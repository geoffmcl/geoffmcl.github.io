# github io test #

20150906: After renaming repository to `geoffmcl.github.io` from just `github.io`! **Important** change since it adds an easier way to view HTML.

20131121: Test of viewing as well as storing web content on github

## To view a HTML file... ##

1: Double click on the file to get a 'blob' view

https://github.com/geoffmcl/geoffmcl.github.io/blob/master/index.html

2: Select the *Raw* view tab

https://raw.github.com/geoffmcl/geoffmcl.github.io/master/index.html

3: Remove the first dot (.) from the URL

https://rawgithub.com/geoffmcl/geoffmcl.github.io/master/index.html

And BINGO, you have a html view ;=))

4: But the simplest, and important idea, is that that URL can be reduced to -

http://geoffmcl.github.io/

A COOL way to HOST html on GitHub. Yes, there are some restrictions as to what the GitHub HTTP server will handle, like say server side scripts, such as PHP, ... but for most normal HTML pages, it is fine.

And also note the GitHub html server caches the html files, so after a html change, sometimes it can be several seconds before the change appears, after a required refresh...

Thanks to Theo for pointing out this important repo naming convention that makes this html viewing simple.
